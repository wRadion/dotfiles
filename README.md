## Dependencies

Everything should be installed during the installation.

Supported OS (yet):
- ArchLinux (`pacman` is required)

Execute as root the `install.sh` with your OS :

```

```

## TODO

- [ ] (MacOS) Add iterm profile
- [ ] (Global) More text at runtime on what is actually installed and what is it doing
