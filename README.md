# dotfiles

## Dependencies

Everything should be installed during the installation.

On MacOSX, you will need `brew` already installed.

On Linux, the `install.sh` will install Linuxbrew.

## Installation

Execute the `install.sh` :

```
$ ./install.sh
```

You will be prompted to install (or not) each stuff.

## Notes

**/!\ Not tested on Linux /!\**

## TODO

- [ ] Test it on Linux (especially with Linuxbrew)
- [ ] Make it generic for every dotfile (not add one dotfile at a time in the `install.sh`)
- [ ] Improve to have separated applications (vim, zsh, ...) and not configure everything at once without knowing
weither or not it is installed
- [ ] Add/install/configure fonts (DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline)
- [ ] Add iterm profile(?)
- [ ] More documentation on what is actually installed and what is it doing
