## Dependencies

Everything should be installed during the installation.

On MacOSX, you will need `brew` already installed.

On Linux, the `install.sh` will try to detect your package-manager.

Only those are implemented yet:
- `apt-get`
- `pacman`
- `yaourt`
- `yum`

## Installation

Execute the `install.sh` :

```
$ ./install.sh
```

## Notes

**/!\ Not tested on Linux /!\**

## TODO

- [ ] Test it on Linux
- [ ] Add Linux specific packages (xorg, i3, ...)
- [ ] Add/install/configure fonts (DejaVu Sans Mono for Powerline)
- [ ] Add iterm profile(?)
- [ ] More documentation on what is actually installed and what is it doing
